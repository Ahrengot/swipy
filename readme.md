# Swipy
Just a silly little experiemnt. Trying to recreate [Swipes](http://swipesapp.com/) with HTML/JS/CSS.

## Project details
* Built with [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Jam](http://jamjs.org/).
* This is only targeted at smart phones, so no Modernizr and no polyfills for old stupid browsers.
* Want to see more of my work? Check out my portfolio at [http://ahrengot.com](http://ahrengot.com).

** Have a nice day! **
