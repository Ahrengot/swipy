### Steps to create a build
1. `$ cd app-directory` Make sure you're in the right directory, dummy.
2. `git pull` Always pull latest version first
3. `npm install` Installs dependencies used by grunt to run its tasks and make the build
4. `bower install` Installs client-side dependencies like jQuery and Backbone.js
5. `grunt build` Spits out a build to the parse/public folder
