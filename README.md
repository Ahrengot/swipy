### Steps to create a build
`$ cd app-directory` Make sure you're in the right directory, dummy.
`git pull` Always pull latest version first
`npm install` Installs dependencies used by grunt to run its tasks and make the build
`bower install` Installs client-side dependencies like jQuery and Backbone.js
`grunt build` Spits out a build to the parse/public folder
